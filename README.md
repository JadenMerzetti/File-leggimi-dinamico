## Description
The Dynamic README Generator is a command-line application designed to streamline the process of creating well-structured and informative README files for your projects. Rather than manually writing and formatting README files, this tool allows you to generate README files dynamically based on your input.

## How It Works
When you run the application, it prompts you with a series of questions to gather information about your project. The questions cover various aspects, including the project's title, description, installation instructions, usage details, license choice, contribution guidelines, testing instructions, and contact information. The application then uses your answers to generate a comprehensive README file.

## Features
- User-friendly command-line interface for generating README files.
- Customizable README content based on your project details.
- License badge and link integration to indicate the chosen license.
- Clear structure with sections for installation, usage, license, contribution, testing, and contact details.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using the command: `npm install`
4. Run the application using the command: `node index.js`
5. Follow the prompts and provide accurate information about your project.
6. Once you've completed all the prompts, the application will generate a README file named `README.md` in the project directory.
